Description: Implements ToMATo, DBCAN, Ripley K, Voronoi tesselation and KDE based cluster analysis. Persientent homology is also implented through TDA and the GHUDI library. Wrapper for C++ implentation of Topological Mode Analysis Tool (ToMaTo) clustering (https://geometrica.saclay.inria.fr/data/Steve.Oudot/clustering/). Makes use of ANN (A Library forApproximate Nearest Neighbor Searching). Is included.
